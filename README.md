# Obsidian Assistant
## Goal
- Receive notifications for goals and tasks setup for the day and week
- Quickly jot down notes
    - Use tags and/or relate to relevant pages
    - Remind at the end of the day to go through them to escalate these notes to more comprehensive thoughts
- Create and receive reminders for non calendar related events (maybe just for tasks)
- Sent voice memos are transcribed and added as fleeting note
